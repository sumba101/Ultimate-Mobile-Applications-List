Each of these applications are suggested after easily a year or more of usage. Each applications internet activity and community has also been checked to ensure its all safe. 
   
## Basic information and requirements
  * Open source 
    * Almost all the applications that are listed here are open source applications. To those who are not aware of what this means, basically the entire codebase behind each of these applications is available for others to see and suggest improvements to. This brings trust and safety because the code for these applications have figuratively passed through hundreds of eyes, ensuring no shady business. Famous examples of opensource projects are Firefox, VLC players, Libre office, etc.  
    
  * F-droid
    * A famous and safe app store for access to open source applications and projects is [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/). All the applications listed can be found to download in F-Droid application. It is safe and secure.

## Youtube + YTMusic
   [Vanced](https://vancedmanager.com/) is a must have. Through the vanced manager, users can install vanced youtube and vanced yt music
   * Pros
     * Ad free experience
     * Ability to download videos, (cannot download music in ytmusic)
     * Complete control over layout on youtube (example: bringing back original video quality settings, removal of merchandise, community posts, shorts and more)
  Its basically Youtube premium without the ability to download ytmusic songs offline along with more customization control. HOWEVER, there is one important feature that makes youtube vanced a must have. Sponsor Block. 
  ### Sponsor Block.
  With sponsor block enabled on youtube vanced, all sponsor segments, Non-music sections, self promotions, Intermissions, Self promotions are immediately skipped. This allows for users to experiences purely nothing but the content that they want. 
  Even if you have a youtube premium subscription, you can install vanced youtube solely for the ability to customize layout and well as for making use of SponsorBlock feature.
  SponsorBlock is also available as a browser addon for laptops.
## Free Movies and TVshows
  [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/downloads) is an amazing and safe opensource application. You can watch Movies, TV shows, live TV or web channels, for free with almost NO ADS. After installing users can install addons through which they will get access to content. All addons are tested to ensure security. In the age of content split between 10 or so OTT platforms, Stremio is your one stop access to all content.
  
## Web Browser
  * Browser  
    * If you want to maximise privacy and security, best web browser for this is [Fennec](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid) which is a modification on Firefox providing better tracking protection while doing away with proprietary bits and telemetry of normal Firefox application. However, Firefox is still a capable and safe application. 
   The major distinguishing factor in browsers is the addons that are supported. The following list of addons are the most useful addons that can be found in fennec, firefox and also chrome. These can also be added to laptop browsers for better experience.
   * Add-ons
     * uBlock Origin
       * Complete ad blocker. Allows for webpage content manipulation
     * Dark reader
       * Converts all webpages to darkmode 
     * Privacy Badger
       * Blocks invisible trackers
      * Privacy Possum
        * Monkey wrenches common commerical tracking methods by reducing and falsifying data gathered by tracking companies
      * Decentraleyes
        * Protects from tracking through content delivery networks
      * Google search fixer
        * Overrides the user-agent string to receive search experience similar to that on Google Chrome in Fennec/Firefox 
      * No Script security
        * Provides full power over scripts allowed to run in webpages. Not recommended unless a competent nerd. 
## App launcher
  Nova launcher is a famous and flexible app launcher that provides interface similar to that of stock android but with better customizability and features. 
## Photos
  Simple and safe alternative of a gallery and photo editor that doesnt secretly phone home your data is [Simple Gallery Pro](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro). Another useful application for the paranoid is [Scrambled Exif](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif) which removes the metadata from your pictures before sharing them.
## Call and SMS Blocking
 [Yet Another Call Blocker](https://f-droid.org/packages/dummydomain.yetanothercallblocker) is a simple call blocking application for fighting against spam and robo calls. In addition to being privacy focused, the application allows for blocking numbers using regex, which is specially useful due to spam and robo call companies making use of ever changing numbers that differ past the first 4-5 digits, allowing them to pass through normal call blockers.
 To effectively use, simply add all spam calls and robo calls to the blacklist everytime and after a week scroll through the blacklist to find numbers that possess the same starting digits (example: +91211....) then replace all those numbers with the regex (i.e +91211* ), which will automatically block all variants of numbers with that starting sequence.

For SMS spam blocking, [Key Messages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smsBlocker) is a simple and effective solution.

## Firewall and VPN
Its pretty obvious that privacy and preventing data collection is more and more important these days. Here is a simple setup that maximises privacy, security and control
  * Firewall
    * [NetGuard](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.faircode.netguard) is a simple way to block access to the internet per application. This allows the user to even block and control the internet access for system applications which might be phoning home data in the background (Looking at you Xiaomi). 
   * VPN
      *  First a clarification, the application suggested here is not actually a VPN. The reason I have listed it as a VPN, is because its way better than any vpn provider option. Oh, and its free. [InviZible Pro](https://f-droid.org/packages/pan.alexander.tordnscrypt.stable) increases your security and protects you by routing all you internet usage through the Tor network and well as making use of DNSCrypt
     *  DNSCrypt: 
      DNS is used by most applications to translate domain names into IP addresses to find a remote server with the site that you want to visit. But this communication is not encrypted and can be used by attackers. DNSCrypt encrypts and authenticates DNS traffic, thus preventing DNS tracking and spoofing.
          * Encrypts DNS requests
          * Protects against DNS spoofing
          * Blocks ads
          * Protects against dangerous and phishing sites
          * Hides visited sites from your provider
          * Prevents some types of resource locks

  * Tor: 
      Tor encrypts Internet traffic and hides your actual location. It uses thousands of computers around the world to mask your IP address and prevents activity tracking to preserve your privacy and anonymity. Tor also provides access to onion services. These are sites that are in a completely hidden network without censorship.
      * Encrypts Internet traffic
      * Prevents sites locking
      * Can provide privacy and anonymity
      * Provides access to "onion" sites 

  To read more about difference between VPN and Tor check blogs such as [this](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/tor-vs-vpn/). But simply put, Would you rather trust a centralized vpn service (a solid number of which have been in the news for data breach or keeping logs of users) or the Tor network which has the approval from US Military, Edward Snowden, and all those who actually care about privacy?
  
  Dont worry, network speeds are still fast.
  
  Best protection is achieved when using both [Netguard and InviZible Pro](https://invizible.net/en/invizible-and-netguard-firewall/). By setting InviZible Pro as a proxy and routing your network to it through Netguard, you gain the complete ability to regulate internet access for all applications as well as securing your internet traffic.
  
## Second Space
  For those who are not aware, Second space is a very useful feature provided by Xiaomi which allows for users to have clones of applications allowing for usage of dual accounts or storing of secrets. Example usecase can be for dual sim holders who can produce cloned apps to maintain two separate whatsapp accounts. 
  [Insular](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.oasisfeng.island.fdroid) is a great app which acheives this objective
  
## Phone and Laptop connection
  If windows os user, windows companion app is a great choice
  If Linux os user, [KDE connect](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp) is a great choice
  
  Both these applications provide features such as :
  * Shared clipboard: copy and paste between your devices.
  * Share files and URLs to your computer from any app.
  * Get notifications for incoming calls and SMS messages on your PC.
  * Virtual touchpad: Use your phone screen as your computer's touchpad.
  * Notifications sync: Read your Android notifications from the desktop.
  * Multimedia remote control: Use your phone as a remote for media players.
  
  WiFi connection is needed. Works through End-to-end TLS encryption hence keeping your information is safe.
